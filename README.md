# TicTacToe

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that runs in the terminal.  
This project was created as a small exercise to improve my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) skills.

   ```

## How to play

- The game is played in a 3Ã—3 grid.
- Player 1 uses X, and Player 2 uses O. (By default)
- Players take turns entering a number from 1 to 9 that corresponds to the cell they want to mark.
- The board layout is as follows:

```
 1 | 2 | 3
---+---+---
 4 | 5 | 6
---+---+---
 7 | 8 | 9
```

You can either play by **pressing the corresponding number** or by **moving around using the arrow keys/WASD** and then press ENTER/Space to confirm your selection.

## Future improvements

- Support for different board sizes.
- Make a better customization menu.
- Make it so you can know who Randy and TicTaco are.
- Add Player 2 customization.
- Expand game replayability if people enjoy this for some reason.
